* Impermanence
This repository is about creating modules to help users to declare which
state they want in their system to be persistent.

This will help users that want to run on tmpfs for ~/~ and even ~/home~ or
to run on ZFS with rollbacks for those partitions. Maybe even btrfs with
rollbacks for those partitions.
